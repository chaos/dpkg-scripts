Test Architecture

The 'runtests' script is the test driver.  It is called by the 'make check'
target with all of the available tests passed in as arguments.  Successful
tests leave no trace, but each failed test leaves a log file and causes
a nonzero exit code from runtests after all tests have completed.
A summary of pass / attempted tests is displayed at the end of runtests.
The PKG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION field in the package.conf provides a summary
of the test which is displayed by runtests as it runs along.

Each test is self-contained in a package.conf named for the test number.
A special function pkg_test() shell function is provided by each package.conf.
The runtests script first sources the test's package.conf so it can display
the summary description, then it runs dpkg-mkdeb on the package.conf 
(ignoring failures), then it invokes the pkg_test() function with $1 set
to what should be the main deb filename, and $2 = the default deb filename.
The pkg_test() ascertains whether the deb file was successfully built, or
appropriately not built, and may check other things about the deb file(s)
depending on the test.  If the test is successful, pkg_test() returns 0.
A nonzero return value indicates test failure.

At the moment we invoke dpkg-mkdeb.sh from the source tree, but since
dpkg-tmplocal requires setuid root privileges, we use one out in your PATH
if available, otherwise abort.

In order to call dpkg-mkdeb with non-standard arguments, the
PKG_RUNTESTS_MKDEB_OPTS variable may be set in the package.conf.
